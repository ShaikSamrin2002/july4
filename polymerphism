POLYMERHISM : IT IS IMPORTANT FEATURE OF OOPS THAT ALLOW US TO PERFORM ONE SINGLE ACTION IN DIFFERENT Ways
2 TYPES: 
      1. COMPILE TIME/STATIC  :ACHIEVED BY  FUNCTION OVERLOADING
      2.RUNTIME POLYMERPHISM /DYNAMIC : ACHIEVED BY OVERRIDING

  //////////COMPILE TIME 
\\\\\\\\\\OVERLOADING FUNCTION
  class multiply()
{
    static int multiply(int a ,int b)
  {
    return a*b;
  }
  static int multiply(int a,int b,int c)
  {
    return a*b*c;
  }
} 

///////RUNTIME POLYMORPHISM
used overriding method as used before by using same print function for vehicle and overrides occurs in child class
